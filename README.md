# BruitForce_Attack_Facebook

A brute force attack, also known as an exhaustive search, is a cryptographic hack that relies on guessing possible combinations of a targeted password until the correct password is discovered. The longer the password, the more combinations that will need to be tested. A brute force attack can be time consuming, difficult to perform if methods such as data obfuscation are used, and at times down right impossible. However, if the password is weak it could merely take seconds with hardly any effort. Weak passwords are like shooting fish in a barrel for attackers, which is why all organizations should enforce a strong password policy across all users and systems.
